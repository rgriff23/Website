<p><h1>About me</h1></p>

___


I'm a Senior Data Scientist at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Previously, I worked on the digital marketing team at [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/), where I contributed to the full lifecycle of reporting, experimentation, and predictive modeling projects. 

### Progressive analytics

I've sought to support the [progressive movement](https://www.guide.progressivedatajobs.org/02_what_is_prog_analytics) through volunteer and consulting work, including:

1. Contributing to the open source Python library [Parsons](https://move-coop.github.io/parsons/html/index.html), which provides core data infrastructure for the progressive movement. 
2. Serving as a Data Consultant to [Stand Up America](https://www.standupamerica.com/) to support Get-Out-The-Vote efforts for the 2020 presidential election. My analysis of SUA's digital marketing efforts earned an Expy Award from the Analyst Institute.

### Education

I hold a PhD in Evolutionary Anthropology from Duke University and a BA in Human Evolutionary Biology from Harvard University. My academic research focused on using statistical methods to shed light on the ecology and evolution of humans and other primates. For more information, check my [publications](/publications.md)!
