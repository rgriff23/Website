<p><h1>About me</h1></p>

___

**Professional role**

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [BCG GAMMA](https://www.bcg.com/beyond-consulting/bcg-gamma/default), the data science arm of the Boston Consulting Group. 

*Previously*

* I worked on the digital marketing team at [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/) for 2.5 years, where I contributed to the full lifecycle of experimentation, machine learning, and reporting projects.
* I taught analytics courses at Northeastern University as a part-time lecturer in the CPS [Masters in Analytics](https://cps.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-professional-studies-in-analytics-online/) program, where my offerings included Data Mining in R and team project-based Capstone Courses.

**Progressive analytics**

I've sought to support the [progressive movement](https://www.guide.progressivedatajobs.org/02_what_is_prog_analytics) through volunteer and consulting work, including:

* Contributing to the open source Python library [Parsons](https://move-coop.github.io/parsons/html/index.html), which provides core data infrastructure for the progressive movement. 
* Serving as a Data Consultant to [Stand Up America](https://www.standupamerica.com/) to support Get-Out-The-Vote efforts for the 2020 presidential election. My analysis of SUA's digital marketing efforts earned an Expy Award from the Analyst Institute.
