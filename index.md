<p><h1>About me</h1></p>

___

I am a Data Scientist on the marketing team at [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/), where I contribute to the full lifecycle of reporting, experimentation, and predictive modeling projects. In addition, I love teaching and moonlight as an analytics lecturer at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/analytics/). 

I also seek to leverage data science to support the [progressive movement](https://www.guide.progressivedatajobs.org/02_what_is_prog_analytics), with activities including:

1. I contribute to the open source Python library [Parsons](https://move-coop.github.io/parsons/html/index.html), which provides core data infrastructure for the progressive movement. 
2. I served as a Data Consultant to [Stand Up America](https://www.standupamerica.com/), supporting their get-out-the-vote effort for the 2020 presidential election. My analysis of SUA's digital marketing efforts earned an Expy Award from the Analyst Institute. Members can view the [report](https://members.analystinstitute.org/research/stand-up-america-electoral-advertising-program-11988?mc_cid=ad56434e15&mc_eid=74b6c8c8cb) on the Analyst Institute website. 
3. I'm part of the [Ragtag](https://ragtag.org/) community, which helps connect technology workers with the organizations that need them the most.

Previously, I earned my PhD in [Human Evolutionary Biology](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/) from Duke University, where I used advanced statistical methods to shed light on the ecology and evolution of humans and other primates.
