<p><h1>About me</h1></p>

___

I am a Data Scientist on the marketing team at [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/), where I contribute to the full lifecycle of reporting, experimentation, and predictive modeling projects. In addition, I love teaching and moonlight as an analytics lecturer at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/analytics/). 

I've also sought to support the [progressive movement](https://www.guide.progressivedatajobs.org/02_what_is_prog_analytics) through volunteer and consulting work, including:

1. Contributing to the open source Python library [Parsons](https://move-coop.github.io/parsons/html/index.html), which provides core data infrastructure for the progressive movement. 
2. Serving as a Data Consultant to [Stand Up America](https://www.standupamerica.com/) to support Get-Out-The-Vote efforts for the 2020 presidential election. My analysis of SUA's digital marketing efforts earned an Expy Award from the Analyst Institute.

3. I'm part of the [Ragtag](https://ragtag.org/) community, which helps connect technology workers with the organizations that need them the most.

Previously, I earned my PhD in [Evolutionary Anthropology](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/) from Duke University, where I used statistical methods to shed light on the ecology and evolution of humans and other primates.
