### Independent analytics projects

**Olympic history**

- [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) - I scraped and cleaned a complete historical dataset of Olympic athletes and medal results from www.sports-reference.com.  [git](https://github.com/rgriff23/Olympic_history)
    - This dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle over 195K times as of January 2025.
- [Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/olympic-history-data-a-thorough-analysis) - I published an extensive analysis to accompany the dataset, focusing on exploratory analysis and visualization with R.
    - This analysis has been viewed +100k times and copied/downloaded +800 times as of January 2025.

**Twitter analytics**

- [Twitterstorm dynamics](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/06/29/Katie-Hinde-Twitterstorm.html) - I pulled ~5K tweets from a Twitterstorm that embroiled a colleague and did a deep dive into the dynamics of the storm. [git](https://github.com/rgriff23/Katie_Hinde_Twitter_storm_text_analysis)
- [NHL vs female Olympian salaries](http://www.randigriffin.com/2017/05/01/USWNT-NHL-Twitter-popularity.html) - I built a model of `Salary ~ Twitter popularity` for NHL hockey players and showed that if female U.S. Olympic hockey players were subjected to the same model, they would be millionaires.
